          Hi, <br />
          <br />
          My name is Tristan, I'm 31 and grew up in the wonderful state of
          Vermont. What defines me is my intense curiosity and passion for life.
          I have lots of hobbies and interests - from working on a novel to
          climbing some cliffs - I keep life interesting. My newest hobby is
          more of a life-long career type of thing, its called computer
          programming and I love it. <br />
          <br />
          If youâ€™re curious about my journey as a developer check out my
          portfolio. Feel free to reach out via social media or email. <br />
