          I am Tristan. I'm 31 and grew up in Vermont. What defines me is my
          intense curiosity and passion for life. I get excited about the
          outdoors and in particular rock climbing. My background was in more
          academic historical research, but recently I pivoted and began a
          career in software development. What I enjoy most so far in this new
          field is the feeling you get when a particularly tough problem is
          finally solved.
          <br />
